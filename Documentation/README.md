# Metra Electric North

This is part one of the Metra Electric route which covers the network from Millenium South Shore and Metra stations in the city of Chicago to Grand Crossing on the main line in the state of Illinois, USA.
Also included is the South Chicago line which branches off to the east towards the south eastern suburbs. A session has been included which sets some points and adds automatic signal regions.

The included timetable depicts the early hours of operation on a weekday during the reduced COVID 2020 operations.

## Operation Tips

This simulation can be run at speeds up to 4x with no issues, though a slower speed as the simulation progresses is recommended.

South Shore Line services are allocated the prefix "S" and are routed on the outer lines between 75th St and Museum Campus. Metra Electric services are prefixed with "M" and operate on the inner lines 
between these two locations, with South Chicago services branching off beyond the site of the former 67th St station.

Obvious to the operator will be the numerous level crossings along the South Chicago line, make sure to keep an eye on these areas. For realism and a challenge, the operator should keep traffic disruption to a minimum
either by only routing across the crossings closest to a service once it has arrived at the prior station, or manually operating the crossings.
