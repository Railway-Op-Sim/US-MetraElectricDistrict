# Chicago Metra Electric District

This map provides a representation of the Metra Electric District network run by the Metra commuter rail system. The lines are for the most part electrified and consist of three routes:

* Main Line: Millenium Station to University Park
* Blue Island Branch: Millenium Station to Blue Island
* South Chicago Branch: Millenium Station to South Chicago

This is version 2 which now includes both the Main Line and the South Chicago Branch.
