# Chicago Metra Electric District

This map provides a representation of the Metra Electric District network run by the Metra commuter rail system. The lines are for the most part electrified and consist of three routes:

* Main Line: Millenium Station to University Park
* Blue Island Branch: Millenium Station to Blue Island
* South Chicago Branch: Millenium Station to South Chicago

Currently stage one is complete depicting the map as far as Grand Crossing on the Main Line and up to South Chicago/93rd St. The timetable for this stage is now in development, once this is complete the route will be expanded followed by the timetable to stage two.
